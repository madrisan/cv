   {\TeX\ development at Academy of Sciences}

Development of a collection of TeX macros and document styles written in pure plainTeX
for the Royal cademy of Sciences of Turin.

The aim of this project was to develop a document style, using the plainTeX language, 
to easily write Mathematics and Physics papers by emulating the Microsoft Word 
Look\&Feel.
The most difficult part was implementing a complete support for the TrueType fonts,
ot natively available under plain\TeX.
