Linux Open Source Developer with 20 years of experience}

{\narrower\medskip\noindent\it
Starting with a degree in Applied Mathematics and a Master of Musical Arts
in Pia\-no, and then moving on into Cisco WAN networking and network security,
Linux di\-stri\-bu\-tion development,
Linux administration and Nagios/Centreon monitoring in highly demanding
production environments, Linux embedded systems, a short period of Web development,
\hbox{DevOps}, and finally Kubernetes and CI/CD technologies,
I~think I~have a wealth of background knowledge, maturity, and ability
to learn to bring to any new challenge or opportunity.
What's next? Excellent question $\dots$

\subsection{Areas of Interest}

I'm currently busy playing with GitLab~CI, Kubernetes, Docker, SaltStack, Go,
cloud technologies, and improving my knowledge in functional programming,
but my interests in technology and maths/physics fields cover the following
areas (somewhat ordered by decreasing degree of time accorded):

\item{\bdot}
    Maths and Environmental Sciences, currently digging around
    Complex and Dynamic Systems, Chaos Theory, Fractals, Scaling,
    Logic, and Global Climate Changes;
\item{\bdot}
    DevOps, Kubernetes, Infrastructure \& Configuration as Code Technologies;
%\item{\bdot}
%    Climate Global Changes threats (and their mathematical formalizations);
\item{\bdot}
    Functional, concurrent, and Web programming
    (in Python, Go, Scala, Node.js);
\item{\bdot}
    Cloud Computing Technologies, Microservices Architectures;
%\item{\bdot}
%    Physics: Cosmology, superstring theory and \hbox{M--theory};
\item{\bdot}
    Linux, Docker containers and Embedded Linux Systems.
