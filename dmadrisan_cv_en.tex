{\it\noindent
Starting with degrees in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelors in Music and
piano performance, and then moving on into Cisco WAN Networking and
Network Security, Linux System Development and Administration,
Nagios/Centreon Monitoring, Linux Embedded Systems,
Full~Stack Web Development, and Linux DevOps technologies,
I think I have a wealth of background knowledge, maturity, and ability
to learn to bring to any new challenge or opportunity.}

\subsection{Areas of Interest}

I'm currently busy playing with SaltStack, Docker, Go,
cloud technologies, and improving my knowledge in functional programming,
but my interests in technology and maths/physics fields cover the following
(somewhat ordered by decreasing degree of time occorded) areas:
